\section{PROJECTS}
\begin{hangparas}{.25in}{1}
CAPSTONE - OZONE POLLUTION \hfill Spring 2019	\\
Worked with members of NOAA to conduct research on a newly created dataset detailing global surface level ozone pollution. Worked to both examine the relationship between national economic growth and ozone pollution levels as well as using change point analysis to determine areas of significant pollution change.
