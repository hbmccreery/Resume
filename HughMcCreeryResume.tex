\section{PROJECTS}
\begin{hangparas}{.25in}{1}
NFL BIG DATA BOWL \hfill January 2021 \\
Used state-of-the-art player tracking data provided by the NFL to evaluate defensive skills and produced a shiny application to present concise results to potential decision makers.
\vspace{-0.15in}  
	
CAPSTONE - OZONE POLLUTION \hfill Spring 2019	\\
Worked with NOAA to conduct research on a newly created dataset detailing global surface level ozone pollution. Examined the relationship between national economic growth and ozone pollution levels and used change point analysis to determine areas with significantly improving or worsening conditions.
\vspace{-0.15in}  

SPATIAL STATISTICS - MERCURY POLLUTION ANALYSIS \hfill Fall 2018 \\ \indent Implemented kriging methods in R to analyze mercury pollution data from the NADP and predict locations with potentially problematic levels of pollution outside of the dataset.

\end{document}
DATA SCIENCE - STATCAST MODELLING \hfill Spring 2018 \\ \indent Utilized MLB's new Statcast database alongside machine learning techniques in Python to model hit probabilities given the information on path of the ball and create a new metric for player performance


MATHEMATICAL BIOLOGY - DIABETIC GLUCOSE DYNAMICS \hfill Spring 2017 \\ Examined existing models of insulin and glucose secretion in diabetics, introduced new parameters to more accurately represent the impact of diabetes on insulin-producing cells, and used MATLAB to examine the impacts of these new terms


COLORADO ROCKIES CASE COMPETITION \hfill Fall 2017? \\ Developed approximate valuations of each selection in the MLB draft and presented findings to members of the Rockies front office as a finalist of the competition.
